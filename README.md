# Smart_Houseplant_Watering_System
A system designed to automatically water my plant when the soil is too dry.
## About
Welcome to the Smart Houseplant Watering System, a simple system designed around the soil moisture sensor and a water pump powered by a relay converting 3.3v to a higher voltage. When the plant gets thirsty and its soil dries out, the soil moisture sensor reads a number above 2500 and sends water to the plant via the pump. When the soil reading gets below 2500, the pump turns off and the plant does not receive more water. A manual button on the Adafruit.io dashboard can be pressed to manually water the plant.
